# Python-Pizza-Deliveries
This is a simple Python project that simulates a pizza ordering system. Users can select the size of their pizza, choose to add pepperoni and extra cheese, and receive a final bill based on their selections. This project is a great introduction to basic programming concepts such as conditionals, user input, and arithmetic operations in Python.
